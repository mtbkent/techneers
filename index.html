					We plan to hold regular classes beginning in May to give the kids time to practice with programming the robot on a 2014 FLL challenge.  The goal is to teach basic programming techniques and learn new strategies together.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 2015 FLL competition will be published and available closer to September.  By this time, the kids should be proficient with their programming skills and can focus on solving the new challenges and the new FLL project.
