					After a very successful 2015 season, the Techneers are back at it.  The kids are busy solving the 2016 FLL challenge.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>2016-11-12: The Techneers compete in the 2016 regional challenge.</b>  It was a hard fought day overcoming problems with the robot, but the team scored very high in the project and the core values.  To top it all off, they went home with the first place trophy in robot design!
